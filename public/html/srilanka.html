                <img class="abc" src="../images/YalaNationalPark.jpeg">
                <p class="dishes1">Missing Yala National Park while Sri Lanka sightseeing might bring regret to wildlife lovers. It is home to a host of wildlife and birds you are bound to run into a group of elephants bathing in streams, tossing their trunks wildly or leopards nestling lazily on tree branches.</p>

                <h3 class="title">3. Sigiriya Rock</h3>
                <img class="abc" src="../images/Sigiriya.jpeg">
                <p class="dishes1">Sigiriya or the mount of remembrance is a World Heritage Site and one of the most stunning places to see in Sri Lanka. This giant formation of rock rises out of nowhere towering over everything in its vicinity. It is quite a climb to the top but once up there you will get to see a panoramic view of the nearby sights and the Sigiriya fort.</p>

            <div class="List">
                <h3 class="title">4. Nuwara Eliya</h3>
                <img class="abc" src="../images/Nuwaraeliya.jpeg">
                <p class="dishes1">Nuwara Eliya is most famous for its tea gardens and scenery. It is a perfect place to visit for a romantic vacation or for someone who is looking for a relaxing trip. With misty clouds, lush green sloping hills and a train that looks that it has come out of the Harry Potter films, Nuwara Eliya is a hilly paradise and another great addition to Sri Lankas tourist attractions.</p>
